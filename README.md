Problem I'm Looking to Solve 

Modern and designer board games are cool. And I play a lot of them. I have traditionally kept track
of the games I've played or heard about in an evernote note. And if I want to remember 
details about the game (i.e. number of players, play time, etc.), I have to look this information
up separately. If I'm going off on a tangent related to the game, I might also look for youtube
reviews, search for it on amazon, or find people's comments on /r/boardgames. This ends up being
a lot of independent searches. The purpose of this application is both to track games I'm interested
in and facilitate easier research about those games.
